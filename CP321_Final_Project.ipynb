    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "It is without a doubt that we live in a society that highly values materialism, as it leads to elevated social status and lifestyle, but is this truly an indicator of happiness? Can money really buy happiness? In this project, we aimed to answer this very question by analyzing the correlation between levels of income and the state of mental health among Canadians. We defined four pillars of mental health that clearly define the level of happiness, which consist of :\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Very good or excellent self-rated mental health**\n",
    "* **Health care needs associated with mental health problems, met**\n",
    "* **Major depressive episode, measured criteria not met**\n",
    "* **Persons who do not consider themselves a gambler**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample population chosen to be observed were bound by age ($65$ years and up), year $(2002)$ and location (sorted by region). These criteria for positive mental health were cross referenced with the level of income achieved by Canadians. This yielded interesting results. For example, it was found that women are more prone to major depressive episodes, however, lower income earning men, are not. Furthermore, the self-rated mental health varied among lower income segments. Mental healthcare was found to be relatively accessible to Canadians of all income brackets, minus a couple outliers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, unhealthy mental health mechanisms were found to be adapted by those falling into moderate to high income brackets. When observing the four pillars as a whole, it was observed that women as a whole across provinces represented more of those who identified with the positive mental health indicators despite earning significantly lower levels of income in comparison to men.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, there did not appear to be a strong correlation between one's income and their happiness across both sexes. However, we concluded that at a certain income level it may be a contributing factor to lower mental health indicators. \n"

    "In settling upon a research question we asked ourselves the age old question, does money buy happiness? It is certain that money brings with it the ability to sustain a secure lifestyle, but does this equate to the general well-being of a person? The majority of adults were often told in their youth that their happiness could not be bought with money. And although being a subjective question in nature our team postulates that an answer can be arrived at through the analysis of relevant data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very nature of the question ecompasses many different factors to consider, including age, region, and individual characteristics. All of the above are significant determinants of income and happiness. Therefore, in order to be able to isolate these factors, the demographic for this study encompasses elderly citizens, particularly those aged 65 and up. Another reasoning for this is that we are under the assumption that the elderly are relatively stagnant in their walks of life. Many of them are quite established in their lifestyles and attitudes in regards to wellness are quite stabilized. Therefore, the assumption is made that the trends among the elderly will be evident and consistent throughout the research period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in order to reduce the number of environmental factors affecting individuals, the income/happiness indexes will be observed regionally, meaning that the average incomes produced per region will be contrasted with general attitudes towards happiness and mental health from the same region. Through this reduction by grouping regionally and by age, we are able to closely observe the fascinating ties between money and happiness.\n"

    "\n",
    "After formulating a question to guide the study, it then became a matter of finding the right data sets. The open government movement across the globe has greatly eased the search for quality data. First, in searching for relevant data sets we took to exploring the [official Canadian open data site](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data). \n",

    "It was our goal during the information search to ensure that the data sets had some of the same key variables in common, namely region, sex, age and the year in which the study was conducted. \n",
    " \n",
    "The first relevant data set we settled on was the [Income of individuals, by sex, age group and income source data set](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/11100159-eng.zip). From which we choose to focus on the elderly 65 years of age and older from all of the major provinces in canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we first loaded the dataset into a dataframe for manipulation, filtered for the needed year, then the necessary age group, average income of recipients, their income source, and lastly we filtered for so that locales were all of the major provinces. Our last step in the filtering process was to filter twice once resulting in a dataframe which included data for both males and females and then another with data for both sexes."

    "\n",
    "In answering the question,*“Does money buy happiness?”* we selected relevant data sets, filtered and cleaned said data sets and then created visualizations in order to understand the nature of the data and the types of relationships between variables that can be observed. We observed the following properties of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### On Income\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the richer provinces for both males and females included Ontario, BC, and Alberta. We postulated that this can possibly be attributed to the oil industry in Albert, and the larger economies in British Columbia and Ontario with two major metropolitan cities in both provinces (Toronto and Vancouver). Some of the relatively “poorer” provinces with lower average total income included Newfoundland & Labrador, PEI, New Brunswick.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was observed that men made more than women in each and every province across the country without fail. And markedly, in the most “prosperous” province for both male and female earners where the joint average total income level was at its highest the income inequality was extremely significant as well with females in Ontario making $13,200$ less than their male counterparts. We posit that among the elderly, gender roles are more likely than not traditional in nature. As men were more traditionally expected to be present in the workforce and women to stay home and tend to domestic affairs. This may explain the discrepancy along with the glass ceiling that remains even today.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Correlation with Mental Health Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Although numbers across the country were high for the percentage of people in each province that did not encounter barriers to mental health services, after a relative inspection of the data one can observe that this mental health metric across the country was best in New Brunswick and and at its worst in Alberta. \n",
    "\n",
    "After isolating the datasets on their own and looking for overarching trends, we began a comparison of mental health indicators. The first of which was income and **the likelihood of avoiding a major depressive episode (MDE)**. We observed that, on a nationwide scale females have more of a chance of a major depressive episode than males . Which may at first suggest that income may function as a contributing factor as the women were making less than the males at this time period. And men did report the highest likelihood of avoiding a MDE. However there was no clear indication that money was a deciding factor for the males in that those males earning the least amount of money reported the lowest probability of a MDE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, for both sexes, there appears to be a pattern in which the lower income segments were found to capture both the lowest and highest rates of **self-assessed mental health levels**. The higher income brackets were mostly found in the middle ground. This indicates that a higher income suggests a moderate level of self-assessed mental health, whereas a lower income can produce either  the most extremely positive levels of self-assessed mental health or the lowest possible level of self-assessed mental health. This suggests that there are factors that influence happiness and mental health outside of income, since income levels were not shown to be a determining factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access to mental health care** can be shown to be relatively equal across all income brackets. This is shown in the fact  the highest and lowest income segments are roughly contained in the same percentile. The highest concentration of segments also appear in the same range. This alludes to the fact that the privilege of accessing mental health facilities are not limited to the income received. However, when we observe the outliers of the Figure 3.6, in the lower percentage points on the x-axis, relatively more women are found to not have their mental health needs met. Since women earn significantly less than men, this may suggest that lower income may function as a contributing factor to low access to mental health facilities for females. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a whole, Canadians who possess a larger income tended to **identify as gamblers** despite good access to mental health services. This may suggest that having more money equates to higher odds of gambling. When we observe outliers who have lower access to mental health services, those with smaller income segments are less prone to problems in gambling, indicating that they do not delve into unhealthy coping mechanisms even when faced with mental health adversity. Generally, these findings support the maxim of, “more money, more problems” as the data suggests that money indeed causes more issues when it comes to gambling.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the **mental health profiles are looked at as a whole**, females represent a bigger portion of those who identify with positive mental health indicators. What must be considered is the blaringly fact that women earn disproportionately less than men. The inverse relation here between income and good mental health are observed. However, this distinction to sex may not be limited to income dicrepancy, and can be influenced by external factors such as gender roles, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, looking at the trends we’ve concluded that although money is a contributing factor to happiness it does not appear to be the sole contributing factor to happiness. In the way that those that believe money can buy happiness believe its impact to be so great. We did not find a strong correlation between income levels and each of the mental health metrics we measured. And we also found that there was a stronger chance of those at higher income ranges self identifying as gamblers. A trait that in extreme cases can lead to one's self ruin, which we viewed as a potential problem. So in response to the age old question *“Does money buy happiness?”*, we believe the answer is no!"
